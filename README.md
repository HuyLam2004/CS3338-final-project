# Formal Objective Breakdown

The core objectives of this project are:

-   To collect, analyze, and visualize publicly available data on
    droughts and wildfires in California.

-   To build a user-friendly web platform that uses ArcGIS for
    interactive map rendering.

-   To educate users about the causes and effects of climate change
    through accessible visual data.

-   To integrate real-time news, alerts, and geographic data related to
    climate events.

-   To promote climate awareness and public engagement through data
    transparency.

# Why This Software Matters

-   **Climate Impact:** Droughts and wildfires are increasing in
    frequency and severity due to climate change. This project helps
    visualize the trends.

-   **Public Awareness:** By showing clear and localized data, our site
    helps educate the public and encourage proactive response.

-   **Decision-Making:** Government officials, NGOs, and researchers can
    use the platform to inform policy and emergency planning.

-   **Open Access:** Anyone can access the site to learn about how
    climate change is affecting California specifically.
